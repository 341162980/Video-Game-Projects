In order to play the game, begin by downloading all files from github. Then,
open up the "Pong" folder itself in VS code. (Don't open up the overall 
"Video-Game-Projects" folder instead)

To start playing, you must first install pygame. You can do this by typing
 the command "python3 -m pip install pygame" in the terminal or 
 "py -m pip install pygame".

Run the "Pong.py"  file in the terminal by using the play button in 
the top right corner. Once the game is run, a window will pop up with the game.

Pong is a 2 player game where each player controls a paddle (rectangle)
and bounces a ball back and forth between each other. Whenever the ball
goes out beyond the left or right side of the screen, the player on 
the opposite side of the one the ball went out on gets a point. The game
continues until a player scores 5 points. Whenever a point is obtained,
players will return to the default position and the ball will bounce
towards the player who just gained a point. The points and player
positions all reset when someone wins a game. 

To move their paddles, the left player uses the "W" and "S" key with "W"
moving the left paddle up and "S" moving it down. The right player uses
the traditional up and down arrow keys. 

The ball moves based on where it hits paddle, not the angle it's coming 
at. For example, the ball bounces upwards if it hits top of paddle and
bounces downwards if it hits the bottom of a paddle
