In order to play the game, begin by downloading all files from github. Then,
open up the "SpaceshipDuel" folder itself in VS code. (Don't open up the overall 
"Video-Game-Projects" folder instead)

To start playing, you must first install pygame. You can do this by typing
 the command "python3 -m pip install pygame" in the terminal or 
 "py -m pip install pygame".

Run the "SpaceshipDuel.py"  file in the terminal by using the play button in 
the top right corner. Once the game is run, a window will pop up with the game.

SpaceshipDuel is a 2 player game where each player controls a spaceship. 

The left player can control the ship using keys W,A,S,D which are traditional
keyboard hotkeys which control the movement of players. The right player will
move using the traditional arrow keys. Both ships use the "option" or "Alt" key 
to shoot bullets. 

The goal is very simple, to shoot at the other opponent and hit them as many times
as possible. A player has won when the opponent ship loses all it's health. 
The ships each start at 20 health points and lose 4 health points per bullet. 
Only 3 bullets can be fired onto the screen at once to prevent spamming. Once a 
winner is decided, the game automatically quits so you need to run the file again 
to play again.
