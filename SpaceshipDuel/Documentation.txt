In order to run the file, you need to download pygame using the command "pip install 
pygame" or "pip3 install pygame". To run the file, simply press the run button. A 
pygame window should pop up with the game running. 

SpaceshipDuel is a 2 player game where each player controls a spaceship. 

The left player can control the ship using keys W,A,S,D which are traditional
keyboard hotkeys which control the movement of players. The right player will
move using the traditional arrow keys. Both ships use the "option" or "Alt" key 
to shoot bullets. 

The goal is very simple, to shoot at the other opponent and hit them as many times
as possible. A player has won when the opponent ship loses all it's health. 
The ships each start at 20 health points and lose 4 health points per bullet. 
Only 3 bullets can be fired onto the screen at once to prevent spamming. Once a 
winner is decided, the game automatically quits so you need to run the file again 
to play again.
