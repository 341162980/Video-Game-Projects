In order to play the game, begin by downloading all files from github. Then,
open up the "SpaceshipDuel" folder itself in VS code. (Don't open up the overall 
"Video-Game-Projects" folder instead)

To start playing, you must first install pygame. You can do this by typing
 the command "python3 -m pip install pygame" in the terminal or 
 "py -m pip install pygame".

Run the "SpaceshipDuel.py"  file in the terminal by using the play button in 
the top right corner. Once the game is run, a window will pop up with the game.

This Spaceship Shooters game is based on the classic arcade game Space Invaders.

A player will play as a space ship and their goal is to survive as long as possible
by shooting enemy players and dodging enemies' bullets. 

In this version, you (the player) will be a big yellow spaceship. You will move using
keyboard arrow keys and you can shoot bullets using the space bar. You will also see
a health bar for the spaceship which decreases when you get hit. Once that health bar
runs out (visually, it will be all red), then you have lost. When you lose, a 
message will inform you of this occurrence, then, you will automatically exit the game. 
You can also exit the game at any time by closing the browser.

In the top right corner, you will see "level". Levels will increase as you kill more
enemies and more enemies will spawn in per level. In addition, you also see "lives" in 
the top right corner. This count is for when enemies simply fly past you off the 
screen. When an enemy flies past you, you can no longer kill them so you "lose a life". 
Losing all 5 lives is another way to lose the game. So as long as you don't run out 
of health or you still have more than 0 lives, then you can keep playing. 

In terms of enemies, they will spawn randomly across the top of the screen and slowly 
move towards you. Occasionally, they will shoot lasers which will hurt you and 
eventually kill you. Luckily, the player only needs to hit the enemies once in order
to kill them. There are 3 colored enemy ships: green, red and blue. 

Good luck and have fun!
