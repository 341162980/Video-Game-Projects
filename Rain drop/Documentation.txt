In order to play the game, you must first install pygame. You can do this by typing
 the command "pip pygame RainDrop.py" in the terminal. (Try replacing "pip" with 
 "pip3" if that doesn't work.)

Run each file using the command "python RainDrop.py" in the terminal. (Try replacing
"python" with "python3" if that doesn't work. You can also type the file "RainDrop1.py"
which adds the character.

The goal of the game is to move your character to avoid falling projectiles.

I call this game "EnderLife", inspired by the Enderman mob (fictional being) 
from minecraft. Endermen are afraid of several objects in the game including water 
from rain. Therefore, the enderman will try to the dodge rain drops in this game. 

Rain drops fall slowly at the start but the game becomes more difficult as more
rain falls more frequently. The game ends when you are hit and you can see the amount
of time that you lasted.
