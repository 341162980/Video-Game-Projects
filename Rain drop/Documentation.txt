In order to play the game, you must first install pygame. You can do this by typing
 the command "python3 -m pip install pygame" in the terminal or 
 "py -m pip install pygame".

Run the "RainDrop.py" or "RainDrop1.py" file in the terminal by using the play 
button in the top right corner. 


The goal of the game is to move your character to avoid falling projectiles.

I call this game "EnderLife", inspired by the Enderman mob (fictional being) 
from minecraft. Endermen are afraid of several objects in the game including water 
from rain. Therefore, the enderman will need to dodge the rain drops in this game.
The player can move the enderman by using the left and right arrow keys.  

Rain drops fall slowly at the start but the game becomes more difficult as more
rain falls more frequently. The game ends when you are hit and you can see the amount
of time that you lasted.
