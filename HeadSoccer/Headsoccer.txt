In order to run the file and play the game, you need to make sure to
have pygame installed. Run the command "pip install pygame" in the
terminal. Make sure to replace "pip" with pip3" if it doesn't initially 
work. 

Head Soccer is a 2 player game where each player controls a soccer player
and kicks the ball towards the other player's net. Whenever the ball
goes in the net, the player that scored on that net gets a goal. The game
continues until a player scores 5 goals. Whenever a point is obtained,
players will return to the default position and the ball will bounce
towards the player who just scored. The points, ball and player positions
all reset when someone wins a game. 

To move their players, the left player uses the WASD keys and the right
player uses the traditional arrow keys. Both players can also kick a ball
faster when it comes towards them. Whenever the ball collides with a 
player, it will rebound away at a constant speed but when either player
presses their side's "Alt" or "Option" key as the ball collides with them,
then the ball will rebound at a much faster speed. 

The ball moves based on where it hits player, not the angle it's coming 
at. For example, the ball bounces upwards if it hits top of player's 
hitbox and bounces downwards if it hits the bottom of a player's hitbox. 
Player hitboxes may be a little off so sometimes, it may look like the 
player has not touched the ball while it has. Also, the player can
only deflect the ball from the front, not the back. 

When the game is first run, both players will be able to select their 
character from a list of displayed avatars. Once a game finishes, the 
window will close but you can always rerun the file to play again.
